# Selenium simple exercises with Java

## General info
This project is my first one on GitHub. Here are seventeen solved tasks form page http://timvroom.com/selenium/playground/. 
I am just a begginer in test automation with selenium+java so they aren't perfect. I was trying to implement PageObject model. 
Of course if you know see any improvments in this project, please let me know. I plan to add a few tweaks here in the near feature (like xml file). 
All the dependencies were managed by Maven with pom.xml.
## Technologies
* Java version: 17
* Selenium version: 4.0.0
* TestNG version: 7.5
* Maven version: 17

## Setup
To run the tests you will need of course Java 17, Selenium 4.0.0 and TestNG. 
Also some kind of driver is required it can be chrome driver or gecodriver. 
Driver must be adequate to the browser version used on PC.
